# giats.me — Personal Portfolio Website

This is the **original source code** for [giats.me](https://marslanmustafa.com), the personal portfolio website of **Evangelos Giatsidis**.

I designed and built this project from scratch using modern web technologies to push the creative limits of front-end development. The site blends smooth animation, layered visuals, and technical precision to present my work in a unique and immersive way.

## 🧠 Concept & Structure

The visual foundation of giats.me is built around a **three-phase layering system**:

1. **The Background Phase**  
   A dynamic, animated 3D world rendered with React Three Fiber, serving as the visual foundation of the site.

2. **The Main Website Phase**  
   This layer contains all the actual content — projects, about section, contact, etc. Structurally clean and minimal to let animations breathe.

3. **The Fluid Animation Layer (Above All)**  
   A real-time fluid simulation overlays the entire interface, using `mix-blend-mode` and the cursor to create an interactive, artistic brush effect. It responds to user input, adding a subtle but powerful sense of depth and responsiveness.

### 🪟 “Window” Effect

Throughout the content layer, I created intentional **cut-out sections** or “windows” that act as **holes in the layout**, letting the background animation show through. These openings create a surreal experience where the layers visually bleed into each other, amplifying the immersive feel of the site.
