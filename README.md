## 🧠 Architectural Philosophy

**muhammadarslan.dev** is constructed around a **triple-layered immersive framework** designed to create depth, delight, and interactivity:

1. **🌌 The Dimensional Background Layer**  
   A living 3D universe powered by React Three Fiber sets the atmospheric tone — acting as a dynamic canvas for the entire site.

2. **🧱 The Core Content Layer**  
   Thoughtfully structured with minimal yet elegant composition to present projects, insights, and contact details. This layer ensures clarity while letting the creative elements breathe.

3. **🎨 The Interactive Fluid Layer**  
   A real-time fluid simulation overlays the interface, leveraging cursor input, `mix-blend-mode`, and layered animation to create a responsive, kinetic brush effect — merging art with interaction.

### 🪟 Surreal “Window” Cutouts

Strategic “windows” punctuate the layout — literal holes in the design revealing glimpses of the background canvas. These openings create **visual bleeding across layers**, delivering a cinematic sense of movement and immersion.
